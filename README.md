# LeagueOfLegends
For this project I worked on data from esport games, more specifically League Of Legends esport.
Using data exploratio I found variabels that I thought would be good predictors for predicting the outcome of a game.
I used a logistic regression model and evaluated its performance and its coefficients in order to get an idea of how well the predictors were at predicting the outcome of the game.
